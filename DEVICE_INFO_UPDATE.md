# Device Information Update Implementation

## Summary
This document outlines the implementation of automatic device token, platform, and app version updates when users login or register in the Waddiny taxi app.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
The User model already had the required fields:
- `deviceToken` (String?) - Firebase Cloud Messaging token
- `platform` (String?) - Device platform (ios/android)
- `appVersion` (String?) - App version number

### 2. Flutter App Changes

#### Dependencies Added
- `package_info_plus: ^8.0.2` - For getting app version information

#### AuthService Updates (`waddiny/lib/services/auth_service.dart`)
- **Login Method**: Now sends device information during login
- **OTP Verification**: Sends device information during OTP-based login
- **User Registration**: Sends device information during user registration
- **Driver Registration**: Sends device information during driver registration

#### Key Features Added:
- Automatic device token retrieval from NotificationService
- Platform detection (iOS/Android)
- App version retrieval using PackageInfo
- Device information logging for debugging
- Graceful error handling if device info is unavailable

### 3. Backend API Changes

#### Flutter Login Endpoint (`src/app/api/flutter/auth/login/route.ts`)
- Accepts `deviceToken`, `platform`, and `appVersion` in request body
- Updates user record with device information after successful authentication
- Logs device information updates for debugging

#### Flutter OTP Verification Endpoint (`src/app/api/flutter/auth/otp/verify/route.ts`)
- Modified to handle login after OTP verification
- Accepts device information and updates user record
- Generates JWT token and returns user data
- Handles both OTP verification and login in single request

#### Flutter Registration Endpoint (`src/app/api/flutter/auth/register/route.ts`)
- Accepts device information during user/driver registration
- Stores device information in user record during creation
- Logs registration attempts with device info

#### Main Login Endpoint (`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)
- Updated to accept device information
- Updates user record with device info after successful login

### 4. Device Information Flow

#### During Login:
1. User enters credentials
2. App retrieves device token from NotificationService
3. App detects platform (iOS/Android)
4. App gets current app version
5. App sends login request with device information
6. Backend updates user record with device info
7. Backend returns authentication token

#### During Registration:
1. User fills registration form
2. App retrieves device information
3. App sends registration request with device info
4. Backend creates user with device information
5. Backend returns authentication token

#### During OTP Login:
1. User enters phone number and OTP
2. App retrieves device information
3. App sends OTP verification request with device info
4. Backend verifies OTP and updates user with device info
5. Backend returns authentication token

### 5. Error Handling

#### Graceful Degradation:
- If device token is unavailable, login/registration continues without it
- If app version cannot be retrieved, defaults to "1.0.0"
- If platform detection fails, defaults to "unknown"
- All device info errors are logged but don't prevent authentication

#### Logging:
- Device information is logged for debugging
- Token values are truncated in logs for security
- Success/failure messages for device info updates

### 6. Security Considerations

#### Token Handling:
- Device tokens are stored securely in the database
- Tokens are truncated in logs to prevent exposure
- Tokens are only sent over HTTPS
- Tokens are updated on each login to ensure freshness

#### Data Validation:
- Platform values are validated (ios/android)
- App version format is validated
- Device token format is validated

### 7. Testing Instructions

#### Test Device Information Updates:
1. **Login Test**:
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Check console logs for device info updates
   - Verify user record in database has device info

2. **Registration Test**:
   - Register new user/driver
   - Check console logs for device info
   - Verify user record has device info

3. **OTP Login Test**:
   - Login using OTP
   - Check console logs for device info updates
   - Verify user record has updated device info

4. **Multiple Device Test**:
   - Login from different devices
   - Verify device info is updated for each device
   - Check that old device tokens are replaced

#### Console Logs to Monitor:
```
ðŸ“± Device Info:
- Token: [truncated]...
- Platform: ios/android
- App Version: 1.0.0
âœ… Device information updated successfully
```

### 8. Benefits

#### For Push Notifications:
- Ensures device tokens are always up-to-date
- Enables targeted notifications by platform
- Allows version-specific notifications
- Improves notification delivery success rate

#### For Analytics:
- Track user platform distribution
