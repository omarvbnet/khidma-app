# Driver Notification System - Complete Guide

## Overview
This document explains how the driver notification system works in the Waddiny taxi app, including how drivers receive notifications for new trips when they don't have active trips.

## üéØ **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: Drivers were not receiving notifications when they didn't have active trips
- **Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive notification system that identifies available drivers and sends them notifications for new trip requests

## üîß **How It Works**

### 1. **Driver Availability Check**
When a new trip is created, the system checks which drivers are available:

```typescript
// A driver is considered available if:
// 1. They have role = 'DRIVER'
// 2. They have status = 'ACTIVE' 
// 3. They have NO active trips with these statuses:
//    - DRIVER_ACCEPTED
//    - DRIVER_IN_WAY
//    - DRIVER_ARRIVED
//    - USER_PICKED_UP
//    - DRIVER_IN_PROGRESS
```

### 2. **Notification Flow**
1. User creates a new taxi request
2. System identifies all available drivers
3. System sends push notifications to available drivers
4. Drivers receive notification and can accept the trip

### 3. **Implementation Details**

#### Backend (Next.js)
- **File**: `src/lib/notification-service.ts`
- **Function**: `notifyAvailableDriversAboutNewTrip()`
- **Trigger**: Called when new taxi request is created

#### Flutter App
- **File**: `waddiny/lib/services/notification_service.dart`
- **Function**: `handleNewTripAvailableForDriver()`
- **Handles**: Local notifications and server notifications

## üì± **Notification Types**

### New Trip Notifications
- **Title**: "New Trip Available!"
- **Message**: "A new trip request is available in your area. Tap to view details."
- **Type**: `NEW_TRIP_AVAILABLE`
- **Data**: Includes trip details (pickup, dropoff, fare, etc.)

### Trip Status Notifications
- **Driver Accepted**: "Trip Accepted! You have successfully accepted the trip."
- **Driver In Way**: "Heading to Pickup. You are on your way to pick up the passenger."
- **Driver Arrived**: "Arrived at Pickup. You have arrived at the pickup location."
- **User Picked Up**: "Passenger Picked Up! The passenger has been picked up."
- **Trip Completed**: "Trip Completed! Trip completed successfully."

## üß™ **Testing the System**

### 1. **Check Driver Availability**
```bash
GET /api/flutter/notifications/test-drivers
```
This endpoint shows:
- Total active drivers
- Available drivers (without active trips)
- Unavailable drivers (with active trips)
- Driver details and current trips

### 2. **Send Test Notification**
```bash
POST /api/flutter/notifications/send-test
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "pickupLocation": "Test Pickup",
  "dropoffLocation": "Test Dropoff", 
  "price": 25.0,
  "distance": 5.0
}
```

### 3. **Monitor Logs**
Check server logs for:
```
=== NOTIFYING AVAILABLE DRIVERS ABOUT NEW TRIP ===
Found X total active drivers
Found Y available drivers to notify
‚úÖ Batch push notification sent to Z available drivers
‚úÖ All available drivers notified about new trip
```

## üîç **Debugging Common Issues**

### 1. **Drivers Not Receiving Notifications**

**Check:**
- Driver status is 'ACTIVE'
- Driver has no active trips
- Driver has device token
- Firebase configuration is correct

**Debug Steps:**
1. Call `/api/flutter/notifications/test-drivers`
2. Check if driver appears in "availableDrivers"
3. Verify device token is present
4. Check Firebase logs for delivery

### 2. **Firebase Push Notifications Not Working**

**Check:**
- Firebase Admin SDK is configured
- Environment variables are set:
  - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
  - `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
  - `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Vercel environment variables
2. Verify Firebase service account
3. Test with `/api/flutter/notifications/send-test`

### 3. **Local Notifications Not Working**

**Check:**
- App permissions are granted
- Notification service is initialized
- Device is not in Do Not Disturb mode

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check app settings
2. Test with `NotificationService.forceNotification()`
3. Verify iOS/Android specific settings

## üìä **Monitoring and Analytics**

### Key Metrics to Track
- Number of available drivers
- Number of notifications sent
- Notification delivery rate
- Driver response rate to notifications

### Log Examples
```
‚úÖ Found 5 available drivers to notify
‚úÖ Batch push notification sent to 4 available drivers
‚ùå Failed to send notification to driver abc123: Invalid token
‚úÖ All available drivers notified about new trip
```

## üöÄ **Best Practices**

### 1. **Notification Timing**
- Send notifications immediately when trip is created
- Don't spam drivers with too many notifications
- Consider driver's current location and trip preferences

### 2. **Error Handling**
- Don't fail trip creation if notifications fail
- Log all notification errors for debugging
- Implement retry mechanism for failed notifications

### 3. **Performance**
- Use batch notifications when possible
- Cache driver availability status
- Optimize database queries

## üîÑ **Future Improvements**

### 1. **Smart Matching**
- Match drivers based on location proximity
- Consider driver ratings and preferences
- Implement driver queuing system

### 2. **Enhanced Notifications**
- Include trip distance and estimated time
- Show pickup/dropoff locations on map
- Add driver earnings information

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- WebSocket connections for real-time notifications
- Live driver status updates
- Real-time trip tracking

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter issues with the notification system:

1. **Check logs** for error messages
2. **Test with endpoints** provided above
3. **Verify configuration** (Firebase, environment variables)
4. **Contact development team** with specific error details
